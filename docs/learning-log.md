# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Glennika Gordon 
**Date:** 10/26/2025

/## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to use GitHub to manage and organize project files effectively.
- How Issues and pull requests help teams collaborate and track progress.
- Why good documentation is important for maintaining clear communication in open-source and professional projects.

## Challenges and Solutions
One challenge I faced was understanding how to set up the correct folder structure and add files to GitHub. I overcame this by reviewing the example repository and practicing how to commit and push changes. I also had to troubleshoot a failed validation, which taught me how to read GitHub Actions error messages carefully and fix problems step by step.

## Connection to My GIS Career
GitHub skills will be very helpful in my GIS career, especially for managing spatial data projects and collaborating on urban planning research. Being able to use version control means I can share code, documentation, and maps easily with other planners or analysts. It also helps build a professional portfolio that demonstrates my technical and teamwork skills.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
